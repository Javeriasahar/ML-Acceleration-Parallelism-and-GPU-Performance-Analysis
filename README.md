# Parallel-Image-Processing-using-Edge-Detection-Algorithms
This project implements parallelized edge detection algorithms (Sobel and Canny) for image processing using OpenMP and MPI. The goal is to enhance computational efficiency and compare the performance of shared-memory and distributed-memory paradigms.
